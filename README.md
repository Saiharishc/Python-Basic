# Python-Basic
Basics of python from mastering python for data science

#Python-Numpy
Numpy-Array from mastering python for data science Numpy produced by Travis Oliphant, which has been produced fundamentally for scientific computing It helps handling multidimensional arrays and matrices, also high level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays Numpy array would require much less memory to store same amount of data compared to python list, which helps in reading and writing from an array in a faster manner.

#Python-Pandas
Pandas library essentially has 3 libraries #1. Series #2. DataFrame #3. Panel Series is one dimensional array, which can hold any type of data, suc as integer,float,string,python objects
DataFrame is a 2D dimensional data structure with columns can be of different data types A DataFrame can be formed from following data structures
A numpy array 2. List 3. Dicts 4. Series
Panel is a data structure that handles 3D data.
